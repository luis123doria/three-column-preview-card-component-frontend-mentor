## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I will practice some Flexbox concepts and apply the Mobile First responsive design. The code can be further optimized, however, I am satisfied with the results in terms of media queries and everything related to it.

### Continued development

I must keep practicing CSS Grid and Flexbox in the following projects in order to understand them better and be able to apply them correctly and efficiently.
